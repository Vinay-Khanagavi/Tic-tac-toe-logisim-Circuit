# Tic-tac-toe-logisim-Circuit
A university project for Computer organization and architecture I've done to simulate an XO which is a Tic Tac toe game using only logic circuits

This project can be opened and played with the Logisim software (you can download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/)

The game is designed to be played by 2 different people, but a creative variation of this project could be the addition of an opponent controlled by the PC that will put its input choice with the random component from the Logisim components library.
Keep in mind that this isn't the best circuit you can get simulating a Tic-tac-toe game, but it's the circuit I've created using my knowledge of logic circuits and Logisim components.

Note that the "main" component where you can play the game isn't the completed circuit, but it's the union of different custom circuits (just to get a clearer view of the full structure, and not a mix of incomprehensible cables)
